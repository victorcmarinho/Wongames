## Getting Started

First, run the development server front end Wongames:
in: ``cliente/``

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
- `storybook`: runs storybook on `localhost:6006`
- `build-storybook`: create the build version of storybook

### Run the development CRM server:

in: ``api/``


```bash
yarn install
```

And run using:

```bash
yarn develop
```

The urls to access are:

- `http://localhost:1337/admin` - The Dashboard to create and populate data
- `http://localhost:1337/graphql` - GraphQL Playground to test your queries

The first time to access the Admin you'll need to create an user.
